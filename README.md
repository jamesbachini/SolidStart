# SolidStart v0.0.2

A deployer for setting up a simple minimalist boilerplate for Solidity developers.

Fork this or download SolidState.js and edit it to set up your own config files and .env files.

Be careful with private keys, don't upload them to Github or you will lose funds. Use a separate wallet for testing and development work.
